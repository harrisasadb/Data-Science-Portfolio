									<h2 class="major">ABOUT ME:</h2>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">Hi, my name's <strong>Harris</strong>. I am a recent data science graduate from the University of Kent, where I was a <b>bestway foundation scholarhrash</b>. I have a celebrated work experience of almost two years in the retail and construction departments of a downstream energy company as an analyst and engineer. Since graduating, I have been working as a freelance crypto analyst to augment my portfolio of crypto assets, where I use my research skills to pinpoint new blockchain startups which have the potential to become future blue-chips.</p>

										<h2 style="text-align:left;" class="major">BITCOIN MULTIPLE REGRESSION INFERENCE:</h2>
										<p style="text-align:justify;">The aim of this analysis was to infer what variables affect bitcoin price the most, based on the size of coefficients of features which we included in our multiple regression model. The aim was certainly not to predict the bitcoin price, but to infer which features were massively associated with it, what kind of relationship they had with it, and whether this relationship was simple or more complex (interaction/polynomial terms).</p>

										<h2 class="major">Clustering Companies Using Cyber Security Metrics, Category Variables, and Text:</h2>
										<p  style="text-align:justify;">Part of my dissertation project. Real-time cyber security metrics data of different companies was provided by <a href="https://www.kynd.io/"><strong>KYND(PVT.)LTD.</strong></a>, which had to be wrangled and clustered using unsupervised machine learning techniques in R-Studio to find out what variables were leading to more or less cyber risks of any type.</p>

										<h2 style="text-align:left;" class="major">Mapping Retail Outlets Based on Their Operational Status:</h2>
										<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an analysis of <a href="http://www.exceedpetroleum.net.pk/"><strong>Exceed Petroleum's</strong></a> database of all their retail assets in Pakistan. Retail sites were plotted on an <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/harrisasadb/Data-Science-Portfolio/02e23dabf323f9a962143e4c58ecf83acc3f5ad7/images/Retail_Sites.html"><strong>interactive map</strong></a> using folium in python based on their file numbers and operational status. This was so that the management can easily run through and make their pricing plans considering how close a site was to its primary freight location.</p>

										<p  style="text-align:justify;">A load calculating software based on The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers <a href="https://www.ashrae.org"><strong>(ASHRAE)</strong></a> standards. The Cooling Load Temperature Difference (CLTD) method was used to code the software in the form of a wizard. The wizard asks the user one by one about the specifics of the volume where the cooling load needs to be calculated.</p>
