										<h2 style="text-align:left;" class="major">BITCOIN MULTIPLE REGRESSION INFERENCE:</h2>
										<p style="text-align:left;">The aim of this analysis was to infer what variables affect bitcoin price the most, based on the size of coefficients of features which we included in our multiple regression model. The aim was certainly not to predict the bitcoin price, but to infer which features were massively associated with it, what kind of relationship they had with it, and whether this relationship was simple or more complex (interaction/polynomial terms).</p>

										<p>Part of my dissertation project. Real-time cyber security metrics data of different companies was provided by <a href="https://www.kynd.io/"><strong>KYND(PVT.)LTD.</strong></a>, which had to be wrangled and clustered using unsupervised machine learning techniques in R-Studio to find out what variables were leading to more or less cyber risks of any type.</p>

										<p style="text-align:left;">This is an analysis of <a href="http://www.exceedpetroleum.net.pk/"><strong>Exceed Petroleum's</strong></a> database of all their retail assets in Pakistan. Retail sites were plotted on an <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/harrisasadb/Data-Science-Portfolio/02e23dabf323f9a962143e4c58ecf83acc3f5ad7/images/Retail_Sites.html"><strong>interactive map</strong></a> using folium in python based on their file numbers and operational status. This was so that the management can easily run through and make their pricing plans considering how close a site was to its primary freight location.</p>

							<p>I am a recent data science graduate from the University of Kent, where I was a best way foundation scholar. I have a celebrated work experience of almost two years in the retail and construction departments of a downstream energy company as an analyst and engineer. Since graduating, I have been working as a freelance crypto analyst to augment my portfolio of crypto assets, where I use my research skills to pinpoint new blockchain startups which have the potential to become future blue chips.</p>
