## **Project 1: Clustering Companies Using Cyber Security Metrics, Category Variables, and Text**

- Project performed in collaboration with [KYND (PVT.) LTD.](https://www.kynd.io/), a cybersecurity start-up based in London, who also provided the dataset of different companies about their cyber risk metrics.
- Wrangled data and performed relevant feature engineering  to prepare data for the multivariate analysis.
- Performed **Principal Component Analysis** (PCA) which reduced dimensions of the dataset to a set of principal components that accounted for maximum variation in the data.
- Clustered data using **K-means clustering** and **Hierarchical clustering** to find which features led to more or less cyber risks of any type.
- The clusters formed confirmed biplots from our PCA, which showed that _high number of e-mails and certificate risk metrics were leading to low services risk metrics_ and vice versa, and that _high number of e-mail risk metrics lead to less certificate risk metrics and vice versa_.
